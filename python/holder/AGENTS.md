# Coding-agent instructions

This repository contains the Python HTTP client for a running holder-daemon.
holder-kit is a separate offline library; do not add native bindings here.

Handwritten transport and high-level APIs may live alongside `src/holder/generated`.
Keep entity and recovery policy in the daemon/core rather than duplicating it in
the client. The incremental change-feed transport lives in `src/holder/events.py`.
Do not hand-edit generated files. Use `python scripts/generate.py` to regenerate
and `python scripts/generate.py --check` to verify them.

`openapi/openapi.yaml` is a verbatim snapshot of the daemon's contract.
Fix contract errors in `api/openapi.yaml` of this repository first, test them with the daemon,
then refresh the snapshot with
`python scripts/generate.py --source ../../api/openapi.yaml`.
Do not duplicate domain logic owned by the daemon or holder-core.
